# `Scratchpad`

Quickly jot down notes. Notes are there when you visit again and they never leave your browser.

## How to use

There is a live instance at [https://pad.prayashm.com](https://pad.prayashm.com). The data is stored on the client using localStorage.
So only your browser has access to your notes.

Hit `Enter` or click on the page to go into insert mode. Type out you notes. Hit `Esc` to go into view mode. View mode parses links,
emails, phone numbers, Twitter handles etc so that they are easy to click.

If you want to run you own instance, see [Setup](#setup)
